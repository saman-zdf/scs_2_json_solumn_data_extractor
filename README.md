### Column data extractor

Before getting started, please make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. After cloning this repository, `run npm install` to install all dependencies.

Add the copy of your CSV file in the root directory

Please `npm run start`. 
You'll be prompted with a question to add your file name. Next you will see list of column names to select from (depending on how many columns your CSV file has). After selecting a column, press enter and the it will generate a JSON file with the prefix of your selected column name in the app root directory.

Once you've done, please remove all the file that you've added in root.
